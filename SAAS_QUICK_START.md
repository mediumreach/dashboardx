## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Billing
Don't build anything else until you can accept payments. Revenue is validation.

### 2. Launch with MVP
Don't wait for perfection. Launch with Phases 1-5, add 6-7 later.

### 3. Talk to Users Early
Get 10-20 beta testers. Their feedback is gold.

### 4. Measure Everything
Set up analytics from day 1. Data drives decisions.

### 5. Focus on Onboarding
First impression matters. Great onboarding = higher conversion.

### 6. Don't Compete on Price
Compete on value, features, and support. Not price.

### 7. Build in Public
Share your journey. It builds audience and accountability.
